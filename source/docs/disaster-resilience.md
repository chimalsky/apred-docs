The Disaster Resilience Index section provides information on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities **BRIC**. The BRIC framework folds the resilient and vulnerable variables of a city into a unified set of indices in order to produce aggregated information on disaster resilience.

> The BRIC framework is provided by Cutter et al. (2010)

The **BRIC** index comprises six categories for disaster resilience:

- [Economic](#economic)
- [Social](#social)
- [Environmental](#environmental)
- [Institutional](#institutional)
- [Infrastructural](#infrastructural)
- [Community Capital](#community-capital)
