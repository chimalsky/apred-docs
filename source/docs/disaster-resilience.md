## Introduction {#introduction}
The Disaster Resilience Index section provides information on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities **BRICs** using the framework provided by Cutter et al. (2010). Cutterâ€™s framework folds the resilient and vulnerable variables of a city into a unified set of indices - to produce aggregated information on disaster resilience. The BRICS index comprises six categories for disaster resilience including, economic, social, environmental, institutional, infrastructural, and community capital.

## BRIC {#bric}
The **BRIC** index comprises six categories for disaster resilience:

- [Economic](#economic)
- [Social](#social)
- [Environmental](#environmental)
- [Institutional](#institutional)
- [Infrastructural](#infrastructural)
- [Community Capital](#community-capital)

## Who does this Information Help? {#help}
1. An EDA Officer looking to review the disaster profile of a county/an applicant.
2. A Local economic developer reviewing sections of their community that needs investment support.


## Computation/Data Source {#data-source}
The disaster resilience index was implemented on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRICs) that was developed by Cutter et.al (2010). A maximal set was implemented, providing indices, and customizable sets of descriptors that cover social resilience, economic resilience, institutional resilience, infrastructure resilience, and community capital. Data from StatsAmerica was used, and additional data sets will be added into our flexible architecture on an as-needed basis.
