## Introduction {#introduction}
The Disaster Resilience Index section provides information on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities **BRIC**. The BRIC framework folds the resilient and vulnerable variables of a city into a unified set of indices in order to produce aggregated information on disaster resilience.

> The BRIC framework is provided by Cutter et al. (2010)

## BRIC {#bric}
The **BRIC** index comprises six categories for disaster resilience:

- [Economic](#economic)
- [Social](#social)
- [Environmental](#environmental)
- [Institutional](#institutional)
- [Infrastructural](#infrastructural)
- [Community Capital](#community-capital)

## Computation/Data Source {#data-source}
The disaster resilience index was implemented on the Baseline Resilience Indicators for Communities (BRICs) that was developed by Cutter et.al (2010). A maximal set was implemented, providing indices, and customizable sets of descriptors that cover social resilience, economic resilience, institutional resilience, infrastructure resilience, and community capital. Data from StatsAmerica was used, and additional data sets will be added into our flexible architecture on an as-needed basis.Â
