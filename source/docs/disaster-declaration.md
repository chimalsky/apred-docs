## Introduction {#introduction}
The disaster declaration section of the APRED platform provides the EDA officers, state, and local economic administrators with current and historical information on disaster supplemental appropriation. 

Employing data sets from the EDA expenditures on disaster supplemental funding, 
the platform uses text mining techniques to categorize EDA expenditures according to counties and expenditure type. 
Implementing this platform is essential because it will allow the EDA officers and economic developers to quickly access 
information on counties that qualify for disaster supplemental funding.

## Action 1 {#action-1}
Some type of action here that helps people.

## Action 2 {#action-2}
Another type of action related to disaster declaration here.

## Computation/Data Source {#data-source}
The disaster declaration section was implemented based on available public data from EDA relating to the FY2012 supplemental funding. Our researchers applied text mining techniques to allow categorization of EDA expenditures in counties according to expenditure type as well as mapping to specific events back to 2011. The data available from EDA regarding disbursements includes project identifiers, applicants, amount of funds paid by EDA, amount paid by local applicants, the EDA program from which the funds were taken, location information including state and county, estimates of jobs created and jobs saved, estimated private investment, and detailed project description including keywords.
