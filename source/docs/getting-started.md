## Introduction {#introduction}
The APRED platform provides information on the disaster profile of counties across the United States including reports on their disaster resilience levels, business vulnerability index, and storm history. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to navigate the three sections of APRED: __[FEMA Disaster Declarations](#fema-disaster-declarations),
[Disaster Resilience](#disaster-resilience), and [EDA Supplemental Awards](#eda-supplemental-awards)__. Let's begin by navigating to the FEMA Disaster Declaration section of the tool.
