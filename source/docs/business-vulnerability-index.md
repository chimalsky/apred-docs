The Business Vulnerability section presents information on the number of businesses in an area that could be more vulnerable to disasters because of the nature of the business. 

> To calculate the BVI, we isolated businesses by NAICS code from the Censusâ€™ most recent County Business Patterns based on their vulnerability to a disaster.

Businesses that were identified to be especially vulnerable to a disaster are those which are dependent on supply chains, have a high reliance on public utilities like water and electricity, or have a large infrastructure footprint and low infrastructure mobility. 

> These qualities were identified to be contributing factors to high vulnerability in a paper that describes surveys to local businesses around New Orleans (AECOM, 2016), a city with considerable experience with natural disasters. 

> We calculated business vulnerability as the percentage of businesses in a county that does not fall into the identified list of NAICS codes that represent vulnerable businesses; this calculation is normalized in the same way as indices calculated in Cutter (2010) to yield values between 0 and 1.
