                APRED provides information on the Major Disaster Declarations declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
                Relief and Emergency Assistance Act that may support eligibility for investment assistance from 
                EDA (the U.S. Economic Development Administration).The EDA provides investment assistance to communities 
                and regions to device and implement long-term economic recovery strategies through a variety of 
                construction and non-construction projects.

            <p class="mt-4 max-w-xl">
                APRED also allows economic development practitioners to explore the disaster resilience 
                scores of their county, likewise, the number of businesses within their county that 
                could be more vulnerable to hazards and disasters because of the nature of the business, 
                i.e., low infrastructure mobility, high reliance on public utilities like water and electricity, etc. 
                Further, the end-users can also use APRED to review the storm history of the given county.
